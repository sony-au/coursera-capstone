## IBM Data Science Capstone Project: The Battle of the Neighborhoods

## Sony Jufri

In this project, I worked with the Toronto and New York datasets from the Wikipedia page and used k-means clustering algorithm and several visualization techniques to assess the prospect of opening a yoga studio in one of these cities. Simple web-scraping tool was used to obtain the data and different data preprocessing techniques were utilised to transform the data. The insights derived from this analysis was then used to help the company decide which city was the right market to go into as their first major overseas investment.
